## Description

Goals:

* Hardware accelerated display!
* Custom software (Lakka / RetroArch)
* High quality case and buttons
* Small form factor

A very affordable portable console will be made using a 120 FPS 320x240 display and a Raspberry Pi Zero. It will be thin and tiny: only 65 mm x 100 mm PCB!

The Lakka distribution powered by RetroArch will be used because of its speed, its fast power-on and instant power-off and its potential to run many retro and hipster-retro games (LÖVE, PICO-8, Scratch and emulators).

[Jean-André] from France is the software guy of this project. He is the main Lakka developer and a top 5 RetroArch contributor. [David] from Switzerland is the hardware guy.

### Install the Lakka image on an SD Card

Gamegirl Raspberry Pi Zero images:
* [Nightly Builds](http://sources.lakka.tv/nightly/Gamegirl.arm/)
* [Build r21684 (November 29, 2016)](http://static.kivutar.me/Lakka-Gamegirl.arm-devel-20161129161645-r21684-g895e996.img.gz)
* [Build r21570 (August 23, 2016)](http://static.kivutar.me/Lakka-Gamegirl.arm-devel-20160823060147-r21570-g1cacbe2.img.gz)

Instructions:
* [How to write a image to an SD card on Windows & Mac OS](http://trendblog.net/install-raspbian-sd-card-os-x-windows/)
* Insert the SD card into a computer. Navigate to the config.txt file in the root directory. Change `display_rotate=1` to `display_rotate=3`
* If your are able to mount the ext4 partition of the SD card add the Gamegirl [controller configuration file](https://github.com/davidperrenoud/Gamegirl/blob/master/Software/Gamegirl_Controller.cfg) to `joypads/udev/`

### First boot

The first boot should last 1.5 minutes and the subsequent boots should last less than 30 seconds, depending on your SD card speeds.

If on first boot the screen stays blank (white) for more than 3-5 minutes, power off the device then power back on. The screen should change the background to black then display the main menue after about 30 seconds.

If you didn't add the Gamegirl config file the buttons will be switched around. Right is down, down is right, Start is A(Accept). You will have to navigate to 'Settings/Input/Player' and select 'Bind all'
